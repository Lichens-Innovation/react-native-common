# Rinno React Common Module

This repository contains common components, utilities, and services used across React Native Expo applications.

## Reusable Components

- Safe area containers, centered layouts, tab bar components
- ErrorBoundary, Snackbar notifications, loading spinners, progress indicators
- various interactive components (dropdowns, bottom sheets, etc.)
- global theme and light/dark modes support

### Services, Utilities and Hooks

- `@tanstack/react-query` hooks
- `MMKV`-based efficient data persistence (native storage solution)
- HTTP `Axios` configuration, Digest authentication support
- File operations, image processing, filename management
- Device detection (`Bonjour` service) environment config
- WiFi and available networks detection
- hooks for Expo updates detection, image picking, animations...
- `WebView` integration hooks and utilities
- I18N internationalization (`i18next` setup and files)
- `logging` service (`Sentry`, file-base, console, in-memory)
- various helper functions (strings, dates, base64...)
- types, interfaces, constants

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- Yarn

| Command           | Description                                         |
|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| `yarn build`      | Cleans the dist folder and compiles TypeScript      |
| `yarn clean:node` | Removes node_modules directories and yarn.lock file |
| `yarn clean:dist` | Removes the dist directory                          |
| `yarn test`       | Runs tests using Vitest                             |


## Peer Dependencies

This package uses a **peer dependencies** approach for all React Native, Expo, and shared ecosystem libraries. Here's why and how it works:

### Why Peer Dependencies?

- **Avoid duplicate packages**: Prevents bundling the same libraries multiple times in the final app
- **Version control**: The consuming app controls the exact versions of critical dependencies like React Native and Expo
- **Bundle size optimization**: Reduces the final app bundle size by sharing common dependencies
- **Consistency**: Ensures all parts of the app use the same version of core libraries

### Our Implementation Strategy

We keep dependencies in three categories:

1. **`dependencies`**: Pure utility libraries specific to this package (date-fns, immer, handlebars, etc.)
2. **`devDependencies`**: All React Native, Expo, and ecosystem packages needed for compilation and type checking
3. **`peerDependencies`**: Same packages as devDependencies, indicating what the consuming app must provide

### Why devDependencies + peerDependencies?

This dual approach solves the compilation problem while maintaining clean dependency resolution:

- **`devDependencies`** provide the necessary packages and types for TypeScript compilation
- **`peerDependencies`** inform the consuming app about required dependencies and versions
- The final app bundle only includes one copy of each shared dependency

## WinRT integration

Interfaces and types are generated by the `react-native-winrt` package at build time of the desktop application. To ensure compatibility and avoid conflicts, the generated types should be placed in the `src/types/winrt` folder of current project. Here's how to do it. Copy all generated types from:

  - `rinno-manufacture-app-desktop\node_modules\react-native-winrt\windows\WinRTTurboModule\Generated Files\types\`
  - to `src\types\winrt\`

## Project coding guidelines

Adhering to established coding guidelines is essential for developing efficient, maintainable, and scalable software. These guidelines promote consistency across codebases, making it easier for teams to collaborate and for new developers to understand existing code. By following standardized patterns, such as those outlined in the [Coding guidelines](https://github.com/amwebexpert/chrome-extensions-collection/blob/master/packages/coding-guide-helper/public/markdowns/table-of-content.md), developers can reduce errors and enhance code readability.
